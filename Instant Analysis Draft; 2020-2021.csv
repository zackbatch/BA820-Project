#,Year,TEAM,PLAYER SELECTED,PICK GRADE,INSTANT ANALYSIS
1,2020,Minnesota,Anthony Edwards,A,"It is extremely rare to see a consensus No. 1 overall pick generate such varying scouting assessments. From the right angle, Anthony Edwards looks like a next-generation Dwyane Wade. From another, he looks more like Dion Waiters. When he's at his best, Edwards is a fearsome slasher with second-to-none body control and dynamite athleticism. He is absolutely enormous for a wing – he looks more like a running back than a shooting guard. He destroyed the P3 measurements in terms of his ability to accelerate and decelerate, but his effort level at Georgia was as inconsistent as his perimeter jumper. He makes a lot of sense as this draft's top pick, because his upside at a valuable position is unrivaled. If he hits his ceiling, Edwards is one of the only players in this draft who could qualify for multiple All-Star teams, and he is an ideal fit alongside Karl-Anthony Towns."
2,2020,Golden State,James Wiseman,A-,"James Wiseman's value can only be determined through the eye of the beholder. There are less than 10 human beings walking the earth with Wiseman's combination of height, length, all-around skill, and athleticism. If he puts it all together, Wiseman could be a healthier Joel Embiid without the addiction to Twitter and Shirley Temples. But if his effort level wanes, we could see another Hassan Whiteside type of center who hoards stats in losing efforts. Wiseman's full potential, however? All-Star berths, All-NBA Teams, and All-NBA Defensive Teams. He will have every opportunity to reach his full potential with the Warriors. If Golden State elects to hang onto Wiseman, it's hard to envision a better situation for him to develop – excellent coaching, Hall-of-Fame teammates, and Draymond Green ensuring that Wiseman won't take plays off."
3,2020,Charlotte,LaMelo Ball,B+,"Just watch him pass. Forget about the terrible Australian league games, where his shot selection was allowed to deteriorate. Forget about his father's traveling circus. Forget about lackluster Zoom meetings or the fact that he hasn't played a meaningful basketball game in years. Just watch him grab a rebound in traffic and survey the floor with his 6-8 frame. Watch him set up the offense as if he is a 10-year NBA veteran. Watch him wiggle and maneuver through creases and spot teammates who don't even know they're open. The best version of LaMelo Ball is everything a team needs to win at a high level – savvy playmaking and an approach that makes everyone around him better. His floor? You saw how his older brother looked during the Pelicans' disappointing run in the bubble. But that passing is the single-best skill any player has in this draft. The Hornets desperately need a star, and Ball brings serious star potential."
4,2020,Chicago,Patrick Williams,B,"On paper, Patrick Williams possesses everything every team needs. A powerfully built 6-7 combo forward, Williams can do a little bit of everything offensively, including flashes of an emerging pick-and-roll game and encouraging range on his jump shot. He chose to attend Florida State specifically to become a better defensive player, where his upside on that end is ""potential All-Defensive Team selection."" However, he doesn't dominate on either end the way one would hope, given his physical tools. He didn't start for the Seminoles (he was the ACC Sixth Man of the Year, but still) and he doesn't command possessions the way the NBA's best wing players do. Does Williams top out as a high-level role player, or is there room for something special? He's more athletic and brings a higher upside than Otto Porter to the Bulls. His skillset provides a nice counterpoint to Lauri Markkanen."
5,2020,Cleveland,Isaac Okoro,B,"Imagine if an M-80 could play small forward. That's what it's like watching Isaac Okoro bully unsuspecting SEC wings last year. He plays much bigger than 6-6, due to his 8-5 standing reach and his impressive athleticism. If you consider motor a skill (I do), Okoro has the ability to play at or near his maximum effort level for much longer than most wing players. That motor helps him defensively, as well – he isn't a ""gambler"" who will rack up huge steal numbers, but he knows where to go and how to hound ball-handlers on the perimeter. He has All-Defensive Team type of potential. His offensive skill level is still a little ways off, and his subpar shooting percentages are cause for concern (28% from 3, 67% from the line), but his combination of youth, athleticism, and effort level make him a worthy selection here. Look for him to have a similar NBA trajectory to that of Miles Bridges in Charlotte."
6,2020,Atlanta,Onyeka Okongwu,A,"Onyeka Okongwu passes the eye test – and then some. He turns 20 in a month, but he has the physical frame of a full-grown NBA veteran. He might give up a little in height and bulk to the truly large NBA centers, but otherwise, he is the ideal modern big defender. He can blow up any pick and roll and protect the rim with the best of them – a rare combination of skills. Okongwu might have the highest defensive upside of anyone in this draft. He remains raw offensively and doesn't possess the all-around floor game of Bam Adebayo (very few players do), but he is a high-efficiency player who doesn't attempt to do anything he can't do. His defensive ability alone will be enough for him to earn playing time while he develops the rest of his offensive skillset. Okongwu is a fascinating front-court partner for the lean and skilled John Collins in Atlanta, and he will bring some much-needed toughness and defensive intensity to the Hawks."
7,2020,Detroit,Killian Hayes,B,"Slick lefties who live in the lane will always have a spot on my team. Killian Hayes might be the shiftiest player in this draft. He can start and stop on a dime and make second- and third-level passes off the bounce with either hand. He can make almost any play a team would need out of the pick and roll, as he has improved significantly as a pull-up shooter. Skeptics would say that much of his best play has come against competition that isn't as stiff as the NBA athletes he'll face, and Hayes might not have the explosion he needs to get his herky-jerky game going. Look for Hayes to develop into a Caris LeVert/Spencer Dinwiddie type of rangy playmaker who thrives with the ball in his hands. The Pistons desperately need anyone who can make something happen off the bounce, so Hayes will get an immediate opportunity to make an impact in Detroit. As much as we like Hayes and his upside, are the Pistons going to regret passing on Tyrese Haliburton here?"
8,2020,New York,Obi Toppin,A-,"Obi Toppin submitted the best college basketball season out of anyone in this draft. It isn't particularly close, either. Nobody in this draft has his flair for the dramatic dunk. No big man can stay in front of him on his pump-and-go game, thanks in large part to his surprisingly solid shooting range (39% from 3 last year). If you squint, you can see flashes of prime Amare Stoudemire in his game. However, he is far more stiff in his movements than one would expect from such a high-level athlete. It has nothing to do with lack of awareness or his basketball IQ, either. He just doesn't move the way you would want him to, especially defensively. At age 22 (23 in March), it's unclear whether that will improve much, either. Look for Toppin to have a similar rookie season to that of Brandon Clarke, who finished fourth in Rookie of the Year voting and tallied a PER of nearly 21 in 22 minutes per game for the Memphis Grizzlies. The Knicks must be thrilled. Rumor has it they were looking to trade up to secure Toppin. They didn't have to."
9,2020,Washington,Deni Avdija,B+,"We can all stop with the Luka Doncic comparisons here, but it is fair to project Deni Avdija's upside to that of 2009 Hedo Turkoglu. People seem to forget that Turkoglu was the lead ball handler and decision maker on a team that made the NBA Finals. Avdija is a whiz with the ball in his hands, and at 6-9, he can survey the defense and make plays smaller players simply cannot see. He is much more active on defense than one would expect, given his subpar length and athleticism, so it's unlikely that he will get played off the floor due to defensive deficiencies. The real concern with Avdija is whether he can make enough perimeter jumpers to keep defenses honest. He is a poor foul shooter (56%) for a high-usage ball handler. If the jumper never comes, he will be less like Turkoglu and more like Dario Saric, who is still bouncing around the league trying to find his fit. It seemed unlikely that Avdija would drop this far, so the Wizards have to be thrilled to snag him here. Will he be enough to convince Bradley Beal to play the rest of his prime in DC?"
10,2020,Phoenix,Jalen Smith,B-,"Jalen Smith – one of college basketball's most versatile and productive big men – put up strong counting stats in a variety of categories as a sophomore. He made an impressive leap across the board after an intriguing freshman campaign, but the most eye-opening improvement came in the 3-point column – 27% to 37% on nearly 3 attempts per game. Smith gets after it on the glass and provides well-above-average rim protection (2.4 blocks per game), but his main challenge at the next level will be whether he can improve upon his stiff, sometimes robotic movements when he's in space. Smith has had trouble adding bulk to his lower body, so he might struggle against stronger post players. But he is a high-character, high-IQ player with a tremendous work ethic and considerable upside. He is a slight reach at No. 10, but he will benefit tremendously from starting his NBA career with a point guard like Chris Paul."
11,2020,San Antonio,Devin Vassell,B+,"Few players have Devin Vassell's combination of bounce and glide. He stood out on that hyper-aggressive Florida State squad due in large part to his casual elegance. Vassell's approach should not be confused with nonchalance – he just plays with a sense of cool. The game looks like it comes easy to him. Much like everyone else on his team, Vassell can do a little bit of everything ¬– handle, spot-up (career 41.7% 3-point shooter in two seasons), penetrate, dish, and fly in transition. The 6-7 Vassell could use a little extra bulk to hang with the NBA's bigger wings, but the main question is whether Vassell is going to bring it every night."
12,2020,Sacramento,Tyrese Haliburton,A,"Tyrese Haliburton's off-the-charts basketball IQ and his magnetic personality make him a coach's dream, regardless of who else is on the team. He is a floor general in every sense of the term, but he can also play off the ball alongside a high-usage player, thanks in large part to his impressive spot-up shooting numbers and his ability to penetrate against aggressive closeouts. His defensive versatility is also quite appealing, as Haliburton is quick enough to slide his feet against speedier guards and rangy enough to jump passing lanes for steals. The most significant red flag? That jumper is funky. It goes in – and it goes in a lot – but it is reasonable to wonder if that low and slow release will be nearly as successful against NBA-level athletes. It would also do him some good to add a little bulk to that wiry 185-pound frame, especially if a team is going to ask him to hang in with the James Harden types defensively. Haliburton is everything the Kings could hope for – sharing the ball with De'Aaron Fox will be a matchup nightmare for most NBA backcourts. This is the steal of the draft thus far."
13,2020,New Orleans,Kira Lewis,A-,"Kira Lewis is at or near the top of this draft class in terms of raw baseline-to-baseline speed. Lewis can fly with the ball in his hands and, at 6-3, can make big-time plays for himself and for others in transition. We saw his assist numbers take a big jump from 2.9 his freshman year at Alabama up to 5.2. He's an emerging jump shooter, as well, hitting just under 37% of his 3s on a good number of attempts. He isn't the kind of dead-eye marksman who can warp defenses with 30-foot bombs, but he shoots well enough to keep a defense honest. His length and quickness will serve him well on the defensive end, as well. His ceiling will be determined by his ability to add weight without sacrificing speed – he tips the scales at only 165 pounds right now. But he is extremely young for a sophomore (only 19), so he has plenty of upside remaining. Lewis fits in nicely with what the New Orleans Pelicans are building around Zion Williamson and should help fill that Jrue Holiday-sized hole."
14,2020,Boston,Aaron Nesmith,A,"Aaron Nesmith hasn't even suited up for an NBA team yet, but he is likely itching to get some shots up. Had his sophomore season at Vanderbilt not been cut short, he probably would have led college basketball in 3s attempted and made. He canned 52% of his 3s on more than eight attempts and filled it up to the tune of 23 points per game. At 6-6 with strong overall physical measurables and defensive upside, the Klay Thompson comparison has gained steam heading into this draft. Concerns still surround his injured right foot and whether his phenomenal 14-game sophomore campaign is the real deal or if it's just a hot streak over a small sample size – Nesmith was only a 33.7% 3-point shooter as a freshman. But at this point in the draft, he is clearly the best scorer available. He should contribute right away for the Boston Celtics, who desperately need some bench-scoring juice to go alongside their potent young wings. Great pick."
15,2020,Orlando,Cole Anthony,B,"Cole Anthony has been on the NBA radar for a very long time, considering he just turned 20. His father, Greg, was a longtime NBA veteran and TV announcer. Cole rolled into Chapel Hill as one of the most touted high school guards and led the Tar Heels in scoring at 18.5 points per game. Anthony isn't a classic set-the-table point guard. He treats himself as the first, second, and third scoring option. He isn't the most efficient scorer (38% FG, 34% 3pt), but he is a shifty, aggressive scorer who knows how to get to the rim and get to the line. He is a solid on-ball defender with terrific size for his position, but Anthony might top out as a scoring sparkplug off the bench if his overall playmaking skills plateau. The Orlando Magic roster is still a bit lopsided toward big men, so Anthony brings a much-needed dimension to their backcourt."
16,2020,Detroit,Isaiah Stewart,C+,"While Jaden McDaniels received most of the preseason accolades, it was Isaiah Stewart who emerged as the most consistent big man on that Washington squad. Stewart bulldozed his way to 17/9 every night with a couple of blocks. He knows how to use his wide shoulders and 250-pound frame to clear space, and his 7-4 wingspan helps him play taller than 6-9. He wasn't asked to play much perimeter defense in Washington's zone, so it will take him some time to figure out how to cover spread pick-and-roll attacks. He also provides next to no floor spacing; nearly all of his offense comes within five feet of the rim. He is a major reach at No. 16, but as Woj reports, there is a personal connection between Stewart and new Pistons GM Troy Weaver. Stewart brings a bit of that old-school 2004 Detroit vibe back to a squad that needs his toughness."
17,2020,Oklahoma City,Aleksej Pokusevski,C-,"Aleksej Pokusevski is this year's mysterious ""guard skills in a big man's body"" prospect. The 7-foot Serbian can shoot, handle, pass, and run the floor like a small forward. His height and his high release point allow him to get his shot off no matter who is defending him. He is a deadly pick-and-pop partner, as he can either be the ball handler or the screener who flares out for jumpers. The obvious hole in his game is his lack of muscle mass. He weighs only 190 pounds and has already suffered a variety of injuries in his young career. It's unclear whether he will ever get strong or athletic enough to play in the NBA. But as one of the draft's youngest prospects (doesn't turn 19 until December), he will have time to develop and mature. The Thunder traded 25 and 28 for the opportunity to roll the dice on him."
18,2020,Dallas,Josh Green,A-,"A classic ""glue guy,"" Josh Green rarely tries to do anything he can't do, but instead focuses on all the overlooked ""dirty work"" plays that help a team win. Green led the Arizona Wildcats in steals this past season and emerged as the steadiest contributor for an up-and-down (somewhat disappointing) squad. At 6-6 and a solid 215 pounds, the athletic Green can credibly guard anyone 1-4 and he shows the rare ability to gamble intelligently for a prospect who just turned 20. Green is also a decent 3-point shooter (36%) and an above-average secondary playmaker/facilitator. He won't create his own offense yet and his offensive upside is perhaps a bit lower than other first-round wings, but it's nearly impossible to envision a scenario where a player with Green's all-around skills ends up a bust. He is an ideal fit alongside Luka Doncic and should be an immediate contributor for the Mavericks."
19,2020,Detroit,Saddiq Bey,A,"The Villanova product has everything scouts are looking for from the SF/PF position – size, length, versatility, and (most intriguing) a much-improved shooting stroke (45% from 3 on a hefty 5.6 attempts per game). Saddiq Bey is exactly the type of player we've come to expect from Jay Wright's program – self-assured, high-IQ, extremely high motor. Bey is a classic late bloomer who wasn't highly recruited out of high school, but he has built himself into a legitimate NBA prospect. He's a smart defender who knows how to use his length and height to his advantage. He isn't the most explosive athlete – particularly compared to some of this draft's bouncier wings – and he isn't the kind of player who is going to create his own offense at the NBA level quite yet. But he has a much higher floor than many of his contemporaries and will contribute to a winning effort in Detroit on Day 1."
20,2020,Miami,Precious Achiuwa,A-,"Once the NCAA and James Wiseman decided to part ways, Precious Achiuwa took advantage of the situation in a major way. The athletic marvel showed there is much more to his game than his physics-defying explosiveness en route to the AAC Player of the Year award. He is one of the best rebounders available in this year's draft – particularly on the offensive glass. Achiuwa was a man among boys on the defensive end, as well, anchoring one of college basketball's best defenses with his unique ability to protect the paint and switch along the perimeter. At this stage of his development, his offensive game relies mainly on dunks and short jump hooks, but he showed just enough of an emerging 3-point stroke (13-40 on the season) to get scouts excited. He isn't a ballhandler or a playmaker yet, but Achiuwa can definitely contribute serious athleticism, rebounding, and defense to any big man rotation. Achiuwa's whole approach will fit right in with #HeatCulture. Imagine driving the lane and seeing Bam Adebayo and Achiuwa waiting to greet you. Yikes."
21,2020,Philadelphia,Tyrese Maxey,B,"Tyrese Maxey is the classic aggressive, penetrating, speedy combo guard we have come to expect from John Calipari's NBA pipeline. At 6-3, 200 with terrific length and lateral quickness, it's easy to envision Maxey capably playing either guard spot, or even holding his own in various three-guard lineups like the ones he helped anchor at Kentucky. His true upside lies in his abilities as a one-on-one defender, where he can apply serious ball pressure the length of the floor. Even though Maxey possesses a nice-looking shooting stroke, he struggled with consistency throughout the season and made less than 30% of his 3-pointers. If he can't get his jumper to fall, he'll top out as a defensive specialist. The 76ers really need a dynamic point guard. He will have an opportunity to play right away, but he doesn't do much to solve this roster's shooting woes."
22,2020,Denver,Zeke Nnaji,B,"It's easy to envision a scenario in which Zeke Nnaji earns millions of dollars by spending this next decade setting screens 22 feet away from the hoop and diving relentlessly to the rim. Nnaji is a springy, lively, wiry big man who plays with an extremely high motor and flashes a bit more interior skill than the typical dive man. He doesn't pick up silly fouls and he knows how to position himself on defense. Nnaji's weaknesses center primarily around what happens when he has the ball and the immediate play is taken away. He commits a ton of turnovers for a big man and he struggles when he has to make even first-read passes out of the post. He also offers next to no floor spacing quite yet, so his offensive role will remain limited. But he brings an entirely new dimension to this Nuggets squad backing up Nikola Jokic. Nnaji will also provide insurance in case Jerami Grant departs in free agency."
23,2020,Minnesota,Leandro Bolmaro,B-,"Leandro Bolmaro is a lanky, high-IQ wing out of Argentina with tremendous confidence and a strong all-around floor game. He plays all-out pretty much all the time, which can be a positive or a negative, depending on the situation. He has much better court vision and passing ability than most players at his size, and he can even make plays out of the pick and roll as a primary ball handler. He hasn't really been tested against NBA-level competition yet, and it's unclear whether he has the athleticism to hang at this level. Bolmaro isn't a knockdown shooter quite yet, either – his fundamentals are all over the place. If he can fine-tune his game a little bit, his energy and court vision could prove to be serious assets."
24,2020,Denver,RJ Hampton,A-,"Much like Haliburton and Hayes, RJ Hampton possesses a unique combination of height, length, and court vision for a combo guard. Hampton came out of high school as one of the highest-ranked players in his class, but an underwhelming, low-efficiency season with the New Zealand Breakers has hurt his draft stock. Concerns surrounding his inconsistent perimeter jump shot has teams wondering whether NBA defenders will simply play under every screen and dare him to shoot. If he can get his jumper under control, Hampton could end up the steal of the draft, as his playmaking skills, raw speed, and defensive upside would otherwise put him in the conversation with his lottery-bound peers. This is exactly the kind of pick we have come to expect from Tim Connelly and the Nuggets."
25,2020,Oklahoma City,Immanuel Quickley,B-,"Immanuel Quickley should be named Immanuel Shootley (sorry). He is a true flame-thrower from behind the arc and automatic from the free-throw line. He can hold his own defensively (6-10 wingspan), which will allow him to leverage his tremendous shooting ability in clutch moments. At 6-3, he will be an undersized shooting guard at the next level, as he has yet to show the kind of passing/playmaking skills to play meaningful minutes at point guard. His ceiling tops out as a Lou Williams type of scoring threat off the bench. He's a bit of a reach at this point in the draft, but he's going to be an exciting player."
26,2020,Boston,Payton Pritchard,B,"Payton Pritchard is what you would call a ""gamer."" Pritchard is a tough-as-nails lead guard and he saves his best performances for the biggest moments. He can – and will – shoot it from anywhere, and he maintains above-average efficiency (47/41.5/82 shooting splits) on a high usage rate. He was the unquestioned leader of that Oregon team, and any NBA clubhouse would benefit from Pritchard's intensity and tenacity. He is older (turns 23 in January) and he didn't really play consistently at this level until his senior season. He'll have to overcome some athletic limitations to hang at the NBA level, but there is no questioning his desire to do so."
27,2020,Utah,Udoka Azubuike,B-,"Udoka Azubuike rarely takes a shot he can't make. He converted on nearly 75% of his shot attempts as a senior, using his enormous 7-foot, 270-pound frame to crush the teenage boys that attempted to defended him. He grew up playing soccer, and it shows in his excellent footwork near the hoop. He is also a tremendous rebounder and shot-blocker. Fifteen years ago, Azubuike would have been a top-10 pick, but the game has moved away from the traditional deep-pivot centers. He will struggle to defend in space and he will likely never develop any kind of perimeter jumper, but he should find a way to carve out a role with his size and skills – particularly against certain matchups."
28,2020,Minnesota,Jaden McDaniels,B-,"Jaden McDaniels is one of this draft's most versatile and skilled face-up bigs. Few players with his height and athleticism also flash his kind of perimeter touch. McDaniels can handle it a little bit and loves to shoot it over unsuspecting defenders who don't think he is going to pull up from 22 feet. His perimeter skillset combined with his defensive upside have some scouts wondering if he could develop into the rarest of unicorns – the rim-protecting high-volume 3-point shooter. The trouble is, at least right now, McDaniels is extremely raw on both ends and often fails to play up to his prodigious potential. He came to Washington with such high expectations, but the on-court production simply did not match his high school pedigree. He has more upside than anyone at this point in the draft, but his team will need to exhibit a great deal of patience while he irons out the kinks in his game."
29,2020,Toronto,Malachi Flynn,A-,"Malachi Flynn is the archetypical old-school ""floor general"" style of point guard. Flynn knows exactly what to do and exactly where his teammates are supposed to be. He won't wow anyone with his athletic measurables or his P3 explosability or whatever, but Flynn just knows how to play basketball. He's a solid perimeter shooter and a magnificent table-setter. He is also a heady, tenacious defender who knows how to pressure the ball and jump passing lanes. At age 22, what you see might be what you get, however. It's unlikely that we'll see him make some major leap in terms of his athleticism or his frame. But at this point in the draft, Flynn makes all the sense in the world for a team that is looking to win as many games as possible and needs another member in its guard rotation who can shoot, pass, handle, and defend his butt off. Flynn and Fred Van Vleet have a lot in common."
30,2020,Memphis,Desmond Bane,B+,"Solid. Steady. Dependable. Reliable. What you see is exactly what you get with Desmond Bane. The 6-6 wing is as consistent in any player in this draft, and he has more game film to evaluate than anyone. After four heavy-minutes seasons at TCU, it's clear what Bane does well – he's a high-motor, savvy shooter with range to spare. He canned 43% of his 3s over 141 college games, including a 44.2% mark as a senior. He crashes the glass and flashes more playmaking/passing skills than most long-range bombers, as well. At age 22, Bane's upside might be limited. His negative wingspan (only 6-4) and comparative lack of fluidity and lack of quickness could hinder the defense portion of his 3-and-D career path. It's not hard to imagine Bane carving out a Danny Green type of role in the NBA, but remember, Green has a 6-10 wingspan."
31,2020,Dallas,Tyrell Terry,A,"Some college shooters trick you into thinking they will be legitimate NBA floor spacers because they can knock down a decent percentage of shots from the college 3-point line. Others find ways to extend that range to the NBA line. Even fewer possess that true floor-warping range that forces defenses to pick them up at 30 feet. Terry has that kind of range. He was one of college basketball's most efficient long-range scorers last season, showing effective spot-up and pull-up shooting ability. Terry is a better-than-you-think defender and a real pest on the glass. He isn't a natural playmaker and, at 165 pounds, is going to take a bit of a pounding early on, but Terry is one of this draft class's most thoughtful, intuitive, and self-aware prospects. Bet on Terry to find his niche in this league. Dallas is the ideal spot for him to land. He brings a similar skillset as Seth Curry, and we have ample evidence of how well Seth has played alongside Doncic."
32,2020,Charlotte,Vernon Carey,B-,"Vernon Carey is this draft's lone true BIG man. The other center prospects are either undersized athletic freaks or extremely tall and lean centers with perimeter skills. At 6-10, 270, Carey can simply lower his shoulder and plow through anyone attempting to defend him. He isn't just a bruiser, though. Carey is a highly skilled offensive threat with surprising agility, tremendous hands, and a consistent approach. He is like a running back who averages four yards per carry – feed him the rock and he'll pick up first downs. He knows how to use his wide frame to establish position and box out, as well. His struggles will come defensively. Teams will pick on him mercilessly in the pick and roll and force Carey to defend in space. Carey could carve out a career similar to Enes Kanter – a scoring/offensive rebounding force in some matchups, and a defensive liability in others."
33,2020,New York,Daniel Oturu,B+,"Few players made a bigger leap from the 2018-19 season to the 2019-20 season than Daniel Oturu. As a freshman, the 6-10 big man looked like a promising rebounder with an emerging jumper. As a sophomore, he was a double-double machine and looked like a two-way wrecking ball, putting up 20/11/2.5 blocks per game for Minnesota. He works extremely hard on his game and he takes coaching to heart, but he will never be the jaw-dropping athlete that currently populate many NBA big-man rotations. He is a bit stiff in his movements and it takes him an extra beat to load up his jump shot. If Oturu can get 10% quicker ¬– both in his physical movements and his decision-making processes – his all-around skillset should be able to shine."
34,2020,Oklahoma City,Theo Maledon,B,"Killian Hayes generates most of the headlines, but France's Theo Maledon is a comparable prospect in terms of height (6-5), skillset, and craftiness. Even though he's only 19, Maledon has a fine ""old-man game"" already, thanks to his assortment of change-of-pace dribbles and wonky floater game. He likes to make plays for others, but he isn't timid in creating his own opportunities. At this stage of his development, his offensive efficiency simply isn't there, due in large part to his struggles from behind the arc. His shot mechanics seem solid, but he doesn't have a very quick release at this point. He has plenty of room to grow, and his overall skillset is quite intriguing. This is a high-upside play that could pay dividends in a year or two."
35,2020,Sacramento,Xavier Tillman,B-,"Xavier Tillman is a smart, unselfish, well-rounded bruiser who competes hard and fits in well with a variety of teammates. He defends his butt off – Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year – and already exhibits a veteran's level of understanding on how to defend the pick and roll. He is a coach-on-the-floor type who communicates well. He isn't very explosive and is undersized at 6-8. It's unclear what position he'll play at the next level, and his 27% conversion rate from 3 is a major source of concern. But it's possible that Tillman will have a similar career path of Grant Williams in Boston."
36,2020,Memphis,Tyler Bey,A-,"Tyler Bey is an unorthodox prospect, but a fascinating one. Much like fellow Colorado Buffalo Andre Roberson, Bey doesn't seem to occupy any traditional offensive role that one would find in the NBA, but he is among the most destructive perimeter defensive forces available. It's unusual to see a 6-7 player play primarily in the post offensively, but he carved out an effective niche near the hoop due in large part to his elite athleticism, length (7-1 wingspan), and relentless effort level. He doesn't shoot it from the perimeter very often, but if that skill develops to even a passable level, watch out. Bey was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year because of his ability to shut down slippery guards at the point of attack and switch across multiple positions. His offensive upside is limited, but his defensive potential is tremendous."
37,2020,Washington,Vit Krejci,C,"Vit Krejci is an athletic, high-energy playmaker with great size (6-7) and court vision. He has played well against tough competition, and will likely continue playing overseas for a year or two before the Wizards bring him over. Krejci knows how to handle himself on the court, but he'll be recovering from a pretty serious ACL injury and has yet to show the kind of perimeter shooting ability most teams want from the wing."
38,2020,Utah,Saben Lee,B-,"Saben Lee is a speedy playmaker who lives at the line and loves to pressure the hoop. He really gets after it on both ends of the floor. Lee is a bit undersized, but he doesn't let that stop him from throwing his body around the court. He struggles to shoot it from the 3-point line and will need to get that sorted out before a team will trust him with major minutes."
39,2020,New Orleans,Elijah Hughes,B+,"Elijah Hughes is a solid, sturdy wing who can get his points in a variety of ways. He isn't shy letting it fly behind the arc, but his percentages dipped a bit (37% as a sophomore to 34% as a junior) when Syracuse employed Hughes as the lead scoring option. He is a surprisingly adept playmaker at his size (6-6, 220) who can operate as a secondary ball handler. He has the physical tools to be a stout defender as soon as he unlearns all the Syracuse zone business. Hughes is an older prospect (turns 23 in March), so his upside is likely limited. But he is a high-character, coachable player who will make positive contributions right away."
40,2020,Memphis,Robert Woodard,B,"Robert Woodard II is an intriguing 3-and-D prospect with serious size, strength, length, and bounce. He can shift between either forward spot and make big plays on both ends. He hit an encouraging 43% of his 3s as a sophomore, but that might be a bit of a fluke, as he hit only 27% as a freshman and has struggled mightily from the line as a collegiate player. He isn't the kind of player who will create his own offense, but he plays a team game and loves to do the dirty work."
41,2020,San Antonio,Tre Jones,A-,Tre Jones is a hellacious on-ball defender and an emerging offensive threat as a combo guard. He competes hard and prefers to make plays for his teammates. He developed into an excellent leader for the Blue Devils and has the right kind of mentality to carve out a niche for himself in the league. The Spurs have potentially found themselves another diamond in the rough at No. 40.
42,2020,New Orleans,Nick Richards,B+,"Nick Richards is a bouncy, dynamic shot blocker who stuck around Kentucky much longer than most scouts expected, but made the most of his time with John Calipari, developing into a much better offensive player over the last three seasons. Richards was almost entirely one-dimensional as a freshman, but has improved in all facets of the game. He is perhaps a bit too aggressive when it comes to blocking shots, because he can get himself into foul trouble. At this point in the draft, Richards is a worthwhile gamble with serious defensive upside."
43,2020,Sacramento,Jahmius Ramsey,A,"Jahmius Ramsey is one of this draft's biggest sleepers. The 6-4 guard can fill it up from all areas on the floor. He is an explosive athlete who can use his handle to get to anywhere he wants on the floor and rise up for thunderous dunks, and he can stretch the floor well beyond the 3-point line (42.6% on more than 5 attempts per game). He is also a bulldog defensively, who utilizes his length and speed to wreak havoc on the perimeter. Ramsey also possesses innate leadership abilities and can't-teach-it charisma. Why isn't he going 20 picks higher? 1) He is a score-first player who isn't wired to run an NBA offense as a traditional point guard, 2) he's a high-turnover player who can play a little bit recklessly at times, and 3) he shot only 64% from the line, which raises concerns on whether his shot will translate to the NBA 3-point line. But as one of the draft's youngest players (turned 19 in June), the upside is undeniable."
44,2020,Chicago,Marko Simonovic,C+,"Marko Simonovic is a tall, nimble big man from Montenegro who can really shoot it for his size. He's a better-than-expected athlete and a sneaky screen-setter. At only 215 pounds, Simonovic will struggle to hold his position without some added bulk, and it's unclear whether his solid offensive footwork will ever translate to the defensive end. His NBA future will be determined by his ability to turn into a deadly 3-point shooter like Davis Bertans."
45,2020,Orlando,Jordan Nwora,B+,"Jordan Nwora is a confident, aggressive scorer with legitimate 3-point range and an NBA-ready body. Nwora can do a little bit of everything on offense, but he seeks to do it for himself first and foremost. He has averaged only a little bit more than one assist per game over three years at Louisville in a situation where he had the ball in his hands quite a bit. Defensively, he has the body and the measurables to excel on that end if he can dial in every possession. But his offensive skillset is undeniable – particularly at this point in the draft."
46,2020,Portland,CJ Elleby,B,"CJ Elleby projects as a prototypical 3-and-D wing, but his percentage took a pretty noticeable dip between his freshman and sophomore seasons on increased attempts. He is better spotting up than he is handling it, and his defensive versatility is intriguing. He is a much better rebounder than most players his size and he has shown flashes of big-game potential at Washington State."
47,2020,Boston,Yam Madar,B,"Most people's experience with Yam Mader has come from breaking down Deni Avdija tape. You're often left wondering ""who is that maniac who is defending everyone full court?"" That maniac is Yam Madar. More than a few draft experts have described him as the Israeli Patrick Beverly, due to his relentless defensive intensity and seemingly unlimited stamina. He is a terrific playmaker, as well, but those skills will only go so far until his janky jump shot catches up with the rest of his game – 26.7% from 3 just won't get it done. If he ever gets the 3-ball to fall, watch out."
48,2020,Golden State,Nico Mannion,A-,"Much like RJ Hampton, Nico Mannion entered the 2019-2020 season as a consensus top-10 player, but he has slipped on nearly every draft board after a frustratingly inconsistent season. On paper, Mannion has everything scouts would want from a lead guard – size, athleticism, footwork, and highly developed playmaking instincts. But all too often, Mannion struggled to put it all together for extended stretches. His deep shooting stroke comes and goes (only 32.7% from 3 on the season) and his favorite shot seems to be the impossible mid-range floater or the contested jumper. He isn't particularly long or active defensively, so he will have a lot of work to do to become above-average on that end. Mannion's success will hinge primarily on whether he can trade low-percentage floaters for more efficient opportunities for himself and others. There is more than enough upside and playmaking intrigue to justify his selection deep in round 2."
49,2020,Philadelphia,Isaiah Joe,A-,"Isaiah Joe is a long-range catch-and-shoot specialist with supreme confidence and a quick release. Joe fired more than 10 3-pointers a game for the Arkansas Razorbacks. The 34% conversion rate is a concern, but there are some nights when it seems as if Joe is going to make every shot he takes. He also made nearly 90% of his foul shots, which speaks well to his overall shooting form. If he isn't the team's primary scoring option, perhaps he won't take so many low-percentage 3s and we'll see his overall efficiency improve as a spot-up player. At 6-5 with nice length, he also projects as a plus defender if his body fills out. His game is a bit one-dimensional at this point – he doesn't make plays for others and his efficiency craters when he has to create his own shot – but there is a scenario where Joe has a career similar to Anthony Morrow's."
50,2020,Atlanta,Skylar Mays,B+,"Skylar Mays might be the most cerebral player in this draft. He is extremely unselfish and one of those lead-by-example types that all coaches love. He can do a little bit of everything from either guard spot and he defends hard. He isn't a particularly explosive player and his upside is limited, but Mays is the type of player who always seems to find himself making winning plays."
51,2020,Golden State,Justinian Jessup,B-,"Justinian Jessup is a southpaw shooting ace who can fill it up from all levels. Standing 6-7, Jessup can get his shot off against almost anyone. He stuffed the stat sheet in all the categories for Boise State over a terrific four-year career, but shooting will be his calling card at the next level. He will need to work to get his defense up to snuff, but there is a Duncan Robinson-esque path for Jessup to follow."
52,2020,Sacramento,Kenyon Martin Jr.,B,"Kenyon Martin Jr. has lottery-level athleticism packed into an NBA-ready body. It's hard to judge Martin's games at IMG Academy because he was simply on another plane athletically against most of his competition. Much like his pops, Martin went out of his way to dunk on people. His floor game and court awareness still have a long way to go, but he is a worthwhile gamble at this stage of the draft."
53,2020,Oklahoma City,Cassius Winston,A-,"What Cassius Winston lacks in traditional athletic measurables, he more than makes up for in craft, savvy, and skill. He steadily improved in each of his seasons under Tom Izzo, and he does all the little things that make a team better. He is a very good 3-point shooter – both spotting up and off the dribble – and he does a great job taking care of the basketball. Winston will be a solid contributor in nearly any guard rotation."
54,2020,Indiana,Cassius Stanley,B+,"If the draft was based on athleticism alone, Cassius Stanley would be a top-five pick. He lives above the rim. If he sticks in the NBA, it's conceivable that we see Stanley participate in a Dunk Contest or two. He's a thrilling transition player and an emerging 3-point shooter (36% on 3 attempts per game). Stanley is also a good rebounder and a physical presence on defense. His all-around skillset still needs work – he isn’t much of a ball handler or a playmaker at this stage, and he's older than your typical freshman (turned 21 in August). If he can fine-tune his skills and improve his court awareness, Stanley could develop into a JR Smith type of player."
55,2020,Brooklyn,Jay Scrubb,B+,"Jay Scrubb is a man of mystery for most, but he was the most impressive junior college prospect last season by a considerable margin. At 6-6 210, Scrubb is an NBA-ready wing with top-level athleticism, quickness and handle. He can convert from 3 and get to the rim at a high level, as well. It's hard to judge his NBA potential given his competition level, but this is a terrific swing-for-the-fences pick deep in round 2."
56,2020,Charlotte,Grant Riller,B,"Grant Riller is a small-school stud who dominated the Colonial Conference to the tune of 22 points, 5 boards and 4 assists. The most impressive part of Riller's game is that he still found ways to get his points against defenses that geared their entire game plan around stopping him. He won't see defenses like that in the NBA, but he will obviously face much better athletes. Riller knows how to play, so if he can find ways to close that athleticism gap, he could stick in the league for a while."
57,2020,Los Angeles Clippers,Reggie Perry,B-,"Reggie Perry is yet another one of these collegiate big men who took major strides between their freshman and sophomore campaigns. He upped his numbers in all the major categories and nearly doubled his scoring average. Perry is much more nimble and shifty than one would expect at his size (6-9, 250), and he can even create plays for others thanks to his advanced court vision. He has the sort of game that can resemble the best version of Julius Randle or Anthony Mason – the bruising playmaker. He's a good rebounder, but a subpar defender – he won't protect the rim at the NBA level and he will struggle to defend high pick and rolls. He can also let his emotions get the best of him if he gets into quick foul trouble."
58,2020,Philadelphia,Paul Reed,A-,"It would have been easy to justify taking Paul Reed 20-30 spots earlier than this. The DePaul product is a tremendous rebounder/shot-blocker and seems to have magnets in his hands. The ball just seems to find him. He is a tremendous athlete who finishes hard at the rim and could provide real value as a dive man on the pick and roll. Why did he fall so far? He has a pretty janky jump shot and he doesn't handle the ball very well. But if a team can clearly define his role, Reed could flourish."
59,2020,Toronto,Jalen Harris,B,"Jalen Harris is a professional scorer off the dribble who flashes impressive playmaking skills and rebounding ability at his size. He can navigate either guard spot and create shots for himself and for others. He was a tremendously productive player for Nevada, earning All-Mountain-West First Team honors. Defensively, he isn't quite there yet. He can get caught up on screens and lose track of his man off the ball. He will need to bring much better defensive effort if his shot-making is going to flourish."
60,2020,New Orleans,Sam Merrill,C+,"Sam Merrill is an excellent deep shooter and a crafty playmaker who plays with terrific feel and intensity. He essentially never misses from the line and he can hit deep 3s in a variety of settings. He gets after it defensively and doesn't back down from a challenge. At age 24, he is the oldest prospect selected in this draft, and it's unclear whether he can do enough things other than shoot to earn minutes on an NBA roster."
1,2021,Detroit,Cade Cunningham,A,"To the surprise of absolutely nobody, Cade Cunningham is the first player off the board. For the past handful of years, the Pistons have been a collection of NBA players without a real focal point, drifting semi-anonymously through the schedule without anyone noticing much. Cunningham won't bring back the glory days of the ""Bad Boys"" or the Sheed/Ben/Chauncey/Rip/Tayshaun era right away, but he gives the Pistons a much-needed sense of direction. Cunningham will likely take control of the offense immediately and help give this squad a sound on-court infrastructure alongside young talent such as Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Jerami Grant and Killian Hayes. The best part? Cunningham, by all accounts, wants to be The Man in Detroit. The Pistons need Cade, and Cade needs a team that will empower him to handle the offense. This is an ideal match between player and organization."
2,2021,Houston,Jalen Green,A-,"Green is an electrifying talent with a sky-high ceiling. He has prototypical shooting guard measurables with off-the-charts athleticism and shooting range. Unlike most gifted offensive prospects, Green likes to get after it on the defensive end, as well. It's easy to see Devin Booker's recent playoff success as a road map for Green's NBA career. Green's most pressing concerns are shot selection – he never met a 25-footer he didn't like, regardless of how many hands are in his face – and physical frame, which should fill out with age/maturity. Green will now serve as the centerpiece of Houston's extended post-Harden rebuild, but will the Rockets regret passing on Evan Mobley here? Skeptics might argue that Green will simply accumulate personal statistics that don't necessarily translate to wins."
3,2021,Cleveland,Evan Mobley,A,"Some scouts will argue that Mobley – not Cunningham or either Jalen – is the top prospect in this draft. No player can match Mobley's two-way ceiling. He is already an above-average performer on both ends of the court, and at 7 feet, he is one of the NBA's rarest commodities – a big man who can stay on the court against any lineup. He is quick enough to defend on the perimeter and long/bouncy enough to protect the rim. Mobley also has terrific hands and excellent touch near the hoop. In time, Mobley might even develop into a high-post passing hub that can initiate offense. Imagine Pau Gasol's interior passing skills in Chris Bosh's body – that's Mobley's ceiling. Concerns persist about his thin frame and occasionally deferential playing style, but the positives far outweigh any negatives. Here's a reference for all the Cavs fans of a certain age: Mobley will look a lot like prime Brad Daugherty when the Cavs host a throwback jersey night."
4,2021,Toronto,Scottie Barnes,B,"Barnes has the body of a Greek god and the jump shot of someone who just started playing basketball a few weeks ago. The positives: Barnes is a true 1-through-5 defensive wrecking ball with truly elite playmaking skills from the wing position. He fills the stat sheet in a variety of ways and always puts himself and his team in positive positions. If he develops any kind of jumper, watch out. But that is a big, big ""if."" Barnes needs more than a tweak here and a nudge there – the jumper needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. In the meantime, Barnes brings such a diverse skillset and positive attitude that it's easy to envision him developing into a high-level role player early in his career. The Raptors have an incredible track record of developing players just like Barnes (Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby), so Barnes will have every opportunity to reach his full potential here. Keep your eyes peeled for a potential Siakam trade soon."
5,2021,Orlando,Jalen Suggs,A,"The Magic front office won't stop high fiving for the next six weeks at least. They have desperately needed a player like Suggs for the last 10 years. Suggs checks all the boxes for an elite point guard – basketball IQ, innate leadership, speed, strength, aggression. If he was a knock-down 3-point shooter, Suggs might've been in the conversation for the No. 1 overall pick, but that aspect of his game slightly lags behind his other impressive qualities. Like many young point guards who handle the ball as often as Suggs, his turnovers are a bit on the high side, but added experience and comfort should widen his assists/turnover ratio. Suggs will remind some of a young Jrue Holiday, thanks to his battering-ram style and imposing approach on both ends of the floor (especially defensively)."
6,2021,Oklahoma City,Josh Giddey,B+,"The high-IQ Aussie quickly became one of the draft's hottest names over the last handful of days, but few expected him to climb this high. Giddey is a walking triple-double threat and might be this draft's best pure passer/playmaker. He plays with an edgy confidence that allows him to quarterback a team's offense, despite being one of the youngest players on the floor (he doesn't turn 19 until October). He is an average-at-best athlete and he struggles with his outside shot – and, perhaps more troubling, at the free-throw line – but Giddey's wise-beyond-his-years approach help make up for it. He isn't Luka (nobody is), but a workable jump shot is what will separate him from becoming either Luka-light or tall Ricky Rubio. He pairs nicely with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander – two odd, unorthodox playmakers who keep the ball moving. He might be a bit of a reach at this point in the draft, but the Thunder clearly love his potential and upside here."
7,2021,Golden State,Jonathan Kuminga,A-,"It wasn't that long ago when Kuminga's name was mentioned alongside (perhaps even ahead of) Cunningham, Mobley, and the Jalens, but his stock took a bit of a tumble during an inconsistent campaign with the G-League Ignite. He is still the same physical marvel – 6-8, 220 with the ball-handling skills of a guard and the athleticism of an Olympian – but his shooting stroke is simply not up to snuff at this point in his development. There is a hard cap on a wing player's potential if he can't knock down jumpers or free throws. If Kuminga gets serious about his jumper and lock in on both ends of the floor – not just the possessions when he has the ball – he has All-NBA potential at the league's deepest position. He might not fit exactly with the Warriors' win-right-now timeline, but he has so much more potential than anyone else available at No. 7 and is clearly the most valuable asset – either as a future franchise cornerstone or a trade chip."
8,2021,Orlando,Franz Wagner,B+,"Wagner has all the tools to become an extremely valuable NBA forward – intelligence, shooting touch, defensive versatility, and even a splash of playmaking. Wagner plays with a bit of a nasty streak on both ends of the floor and never backs down from a challenge. At 6-9, he can handle himself across a variety of positions defensively, while serving as a solid shooter and secondary facilitator on offense. Wagner's best-case scenario would be to model himself after Bojan or Bogdan Bogdanovic, but with a bit more defensive flexibility. If he can get his 3pt% into the high 30s instead of the low-mid 30s, he could get there. Wagner and Suggs bring so much of what Orlando has been missing these last few years – strong draft thus far for the Magic."
9,2021,Sacramento,Davion Mitchell,B,"Mitchell is a ferocious coach-on-the-floor type of guard who will bring a level of physical and emotional maturity rarely seen in a rookie. He often resembled a prime (less thick) Kyle Lowry in the way he was able to lead his Baylor squad to a national title. He scored with ruthless efficiency at all three levels, improving to nearly 45% from 3 as a junior. His counting stats saw significant improvements in all categories during his three-year college career and enters the draft as one of the most ready-to-go prospects available. His upside is limited, however, as he will turn 23 on Sept. 5 and he measured just over 6-1 in shoes. How will he fit in the same backcourt with De'Aaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton? Is there a trade coming? Stay tuned."
10,2021,Memphis,Ziaire Williams,B+,"Williams is coming off an odd and unsatisfying season at Stanford, where he simply did not play up to his potential in 20 games for the Cardinal. He never found his footing, shooting only 37% from the floor and 29% from the 3-point line, despite coming out of high school with the reputation as a long-range assassin. At 6-9, Williams can shoot over anyone, and he can handle it much better than most players his size. There are times where Williams's offensive repertoire resembles Michael Porter Jr. But Williams has a long way to go and will need a team that is patient with him while he works on his body (only 190 pounds right now) and regains his confidence. He might be a bit of a reach here at No. 10, but the Grizzlies (who traded up to get here) clearly see something special in Williams. He makes a lot of sense on paper alongside Ja Morant, and if he can put his college season firmly in the rear-view mirror, he could be a tremendous front-court partner with Jaren Jackson Jr."
11,2021,Charlotte,James Bouknight,A,"He's only been a pro for a few minutes, but Bouknight might already lead the Hornets in shot attempts. At his best, Bouknight is a flame-throwing one-on-one scorer who can put buckets on anybody. He utilizes a unique combination of raw athleticism and herky-jerky change-of-pace dribble-drive moves to get anywhere he wants on the floor. He can finish through contact and knock down foul shots at an 80+% percent clip. On the downside, his 3pt% is much lower than one would expect given his shooting stroke, and he plays with serious tunnel vision. He averaged only 1.5 assists in 43 career collegiate games, compared to 2.1 turnovers. If his playmaking doesn't improve, he might top out as a Jordan Clarkson-style Sixth Man of the Year type scorer. However, he projects as a much better defender than the typical scoring sparkplug (reported 7-foot wingspan and is active in passing lanes), so his ceiling is significantly higher. The Hornets likely did not expect to see Bouknight still on the board at No. 11, and he will step in on day one to contribute to an electrifying backcourt with LaMelo Ball. League Pass alert!"
12,2021,San Antonio,Joshua Primo,B-,"Primo can fill it up from beyond the arc. He has one of the best off-the-catch jumpers in this draft, and he can even put the ball on the floor a bit and attack closeouts. He plays with a savviness well beyond his 18 years – his offensive upside is truly exciting. So why didn't Primo average more than 8 points per game? His average-at-best athleticism and his lack of an elite handle kept him from consistently delivering. He turns the ball over quite often and he struggles to finish at the rim against above-average rim protectors. He has all the upside in the world, but the Spurs will need to be very patient with him while the youngest player in the draft works through the rough patches. He is a bit of a reach at 12, but Primo is a talented prospect who might have gone even higher had he declared for the 2022 draft."
13,2021,Indiana,Chris Duarte,B-,"Duarte is a tough-as-nails wing who can score from anywhere on the floor, while also defending the other team's best guard. Duarte is remarkably efficient, both at the rim (71% near the basket) and behind the arc (42% from 3). His effective field goal percentage (63.3%) ranked near the top among guards. Duarte can guard anyone on the perimeter and rarely finds himself out of position. So why isn't he going in the top 5? Duarte is already 24 and he is limited athletically compared to the explosive guards in this draft. But his overall skill level and tenacity should allow Duarte to carve out a niche in the league like fellow Oregon alumnus Dillon Brooks. He is a definite reach at 13, but Duarte is exactly the kind of player the Pacers covet."
14,2021,Golden State,Moses Moody,A,"Moody is a safe, steady shooting guard who might not have the ceiling of those drafted around him, but he has the highest floor. It's nearly impossible to envision a scenario where Moody isn't at least a solid starter in the NBA for a decade-plus. Every facet of his game is above-average, and his rebounding from the guard spot (5.8 per game) is darn near elite. However, Moody isn't going to break down defenders off the dribble and hit an assortment of pull-up jumpers in people's faces. His one-on-one scoring ability is a bit limited, and he will likely need to feast on open spot-up looks or pump-and-drive opportunities created by an elite backcourt teammate. Guess who has elite backcourt teammates now? Moody could not have fallen into a better situation than this. He will play right away for the title-or-bust Golden State Warriors."
15,2021,Washington,Corey Kispert,A-,"Kispert has spent the past four years at Gonzaga getting significantly better at every aspect of the game. He has willed himself into being a dynamic offensive threat – not simply a spot-up shooter – with solid all-around skills. Kispert can put the ball on the floor and create shots for himself and others when defenses are over-aggressive on their close-outs. He needs next to no time to line up spot-up jumpers, and his range extends well beyond the NBA 3-point line. He also shows a feisty streak on defense, even when he is out-matched athletically. Kispert is big, too – 6-7, 220 – so he won't get shoved around. He is a bit more of a finished product at age 22, but Kispert will look to emulate Joe Harris's success at the next level. The Wizards desperately need shooting to help alleviate some of the pressure on Bradley Beal, and Kispert will come in ready to contribute right away."
16,2021,Houston,Alperen Sengun,A-,"Sengun is the best pure post-up scorer in this draft. Had he come along during the post-heavy offenses in the late 1990s/early 2000s, Sengun would be a top-5 pick. He averaged 19 points and nine boards per game for his Turkish league team en route to winning league MVP at the jaw-dropping age of 18. He possesses a full array of moves from either block and with either hand. He's surprisingly nimble and graceful for his size, and his soft hands can haul in any pass. Sengun can also kick it out effectively out of double teams and find cutters with slick interior passes. He is not going to wow you with explosive athleticism or speed, and it is going to take him time to catch up to the speed of NBA play. Commitment to the defensive end will determine whether Sengun is a spot-duty post masher like Enes Kanter or a full-time top-flight center like Jusuf Nurkic. The Rockets traded up to get one of the draft's most analytics-friendly prospects, and he will have every opportunity to play early and often."
17,2021,New Orleans,Trey Murphy,B,"Murphy climbed up draft boards this year thanks to an incredible all-around shooting season from the SF/PF position. Check out these shooting splits: 62% on 2s, 43% on 3s (on nearly 5 attempts per game), 93% from the line. Wow. He likely wouldn't maintain that kind of efficiency on added attempts, and he isn't built to be a dynamic one-on-one scorer. However, Murphy could thrive in the prototypical 3-and-D role. Even though he's a very good athlete with excellent size, Murphy often doesn't play like it. One gets the feeling that he could do much more if he were to assert himself. He is a below-average rebounder for his size, and he offers next to no rim protection at this point. If the right kind of coach/organization can light a fire under Murphy, they could unlock an extremely valuable player at a serious position of need. He fits wonderfully alongside Zion Williamson in New Orleans. His fit alongside Brandon Ingram? Less wonderful."
18,2021,Oklahoma City,Tre Mann,C+,"Mann made one of the greatest leaps between seasons out of anyone in this draft. He did not look like an NBA player as a freshman, but Mann posted an excellent sophomore campaign for the Gators, filling up the stat sheet in all columns with high efficiency (40% from 3, 83% from the line). He flashes excellent change-of-pace moves and can score from all angles. He is always in attack mode, either for his own shot or for putting a defense into rotation and finding open shooters. Mann is not a high-level athlete and he struggles mightily on defense, but his growth curve is extremely encouraging. Even so, this is a big reach for the Thunder at 19."
19,2021,Charlotte,Kai Jones,B+,"Jones is this year's annual bouncy, high-ceiling, low-floor big man prospect out of Texas. He played in a crowded front court these past two years and didn't have the same kinds of opportunities to showcase his skills compared to some other first-round picks, but Jones has as much upside as anyone in this draft. He plays with extremely high effort on both ends, and he flashes an intriguing face-up game for someone with his athleticism and length (9-2.5 standing reach). Jones has a way to go, but if he can even scratch his ceiling, his game could eventually resemble John Collins or Jaren Jackson Jr. Charlotte traded into this spot and Jones will have ample opportunities to showcase his skills for the frontcourt-challenged Hornets. EDIT: Bumping up his score just a little bit because of that incredible suit."
20,2021,Atlanta,Jalen Johnson,B+,"Johnson arrived at Duke as a top-tier draft prospect, but he left leaving scouts with more questions than answers. The talent is there – it's not often to find a 6-9 wing with his natural scoring ability and playmaking flashes. But he left a bad taste with some scouts after a wildly inconsistent/abbreviated freshman campaign that saw him either dominate or rack up careless turnovers. He is a poor foul shooter and a streaky-at-best perimeter shooter. If he locks in, Johnson could be a TJ Warren-style bucket getter as early as his rookie season. Johnson feels like the kind of player built more for the pro game than college, and he finds himself in a terrific situation in Atlanta. He teams up with his NBA doppelganger Cam Reddish and could pay serious dividends – few players with his talent level end up at pick No. 20."
21,2021,LA Clippers,Keon Johnson,A,"Johnson is a lanky, explosive slasher who plays with terrific intensity on both sides of the ball. He has the tools to develop into a plus defender, combining quickness and length with terrific instincts and a relentless motor. Offensively, he applies that same kind of pressure as a penetrator, attacking the rim and finishing through contact. His biggest issue? Much like Barnes and Kuminga, he struggles to hit shots outside of the restricted area. It's tough to make a living as a 6-5 wing who shoots 27% from 3 and 70% from the line. He also sports a negative assist/turnover ratio (2.5/2.6) and often crosses the line that separates ""aggressive"" and ""sloppy."" However, the foundation is there for Johnson to develop into an exciting, Will Barton-esque slasher who can dunk over anyone. Johnson will bring a much-needed spark to the Clippers backcourt."
22,2021,Indiana,Isaiah Jackson,B-,"The lean, active big man out of Kentucky showed tremendous flashes in limited minutes as a freshman. Jackson tallied an incredible 2.6 blocks per game in only 20.8 minutes per game in Lexington. He runs the floor like a guard and uses that speed to effectively disrupt opposing offenses. Offensively, he shows nice potential as a dive man and a decent stroke at the foul line. He will take time to make his presence felt in the NBA, as he needs to add strength and cut down on his fouls to see increased playing time. Jackson reminds me of former Wildcats Nerlens Noel or Willie Cauley-Stein – tremendous defenders with limited offensive skillsets. Jackson will head to Washington as part of the blockbuster Russell Westbrook deal, and will compete for minutes right away in the Wizards' big-man rotation."
23,2021,Houston,Usman Garuba,A-,"Garuba is a man's man on the defensive interior. He is impossible to move. His quick feet and long arms (7-2 wingspan) make him an ideal defensive weapon. Even though he measures at only 6-8, Garuba is comfortable defending players much taller. There are glimmers of prime Ben Wallace in the way Garuba defends above his height. He shows much more promise than Wallace on the offensive end, but he is still a work in progress. Garuba doesn't show much shooting range yet, and his offensive game consists primarily of lob dunks and put-backs. At only 19, Garuba has plenty of upside remaining, and his effort level and basketball IQ are top notch. He reminds me a bit of former Rocket Chuck Hayes – another human tank."
24,2021,Houston,Josh Christopher,B,"Christopher is a true Jekyll-and-Hyde prospect. At his best, Christopher is an electrifying combo guard who can make impossible shots seem easy, while wreaking havoc on defense with steals and weakside blocks. At his worst, Christopher can toss up multiple airballs, while defending as if he is completely lost. Christopher's destiny seems to be as an energy sparkplug off the bench who can inject a bit of chaos if his team is lethargic. If everything clicks for him, Christopher could be a steal this late in the draft. Anytime Christopher and Jalen Green are in the game at the same time, it will be must-watch TV."
25,2021,New York,Quentin Grimes,B+,"Grimes is a rock-solid 3-and-D guard with deep range on his jumper and a quick release. He connected on just over 40% of his 3s on more than 8 attempts per game as a junior. He's also physically built like a pro and can hold his own defensively against anyone 1-through-3. He won't wow anyone with his one-on-one shot creation abilities, and he struggles to convert near the rim against length. But if his jumper translates to the next level, Grimes should enjoy a long, lucrative career as a floor-spacing wing. He is a true Tom Thibodeau type of player. Strong pick for the Knicks this late in round one."
26,2021,Denver,Nah'Shon Hyland,A-,"""Bones"" Hyland is the type of guard who is ready to get up shots the second he enters a game. He is a threat to pull up from anywhere. He is one of this draft's best off-the-dribble shooters. He has a terrific handle and can easily weave his way through pressure defenses. He is also a better rebounder/defender than his undersized/skinny frame would lead you to believe, thanks to some long arms and quick hands. He is not a natural point guard – more of a poor man's Damian Lillard-style combo scorer – and will need to improve on his terrible assist/turnover ratio (2/3) before he can be trusted with the car keys of an NBA offense. But the VCU product will be able to get buckets from day one for a Denver squad who will be without Jamal Murray's services for at least the first few months of the season. Hyland should be able to feast on easy opportunities created by the defending MVP, Nikola Jokic."
27,2021,Brooklyn,Cameron Thomas,A-,"Thomas is a phenomenal scorer who can catch fire with the best of them. At 23 points per game, Thomas was one of the most purely productive freshmen in college basketball, building on his reputation as a walking bucket in high school. However, Thomas doesn't really create shots for others or fill up the stat sheet in any other category. For a volume scorer, his 3pt% is a serious concern – only 32.5% from the college 3 – but I expect that number to tick upward when he isn't asked to take so many difficult shots. At this point in his development, his defensive approach can best be described as ""disinterested."" Thomas should find a role in the league as a red-hot bench scorer, but he will need to focus on improving the other aspects of his game if he seeks to become a bit more. He will get a chance to contribute right away for a Brooklyn squad with title aspirations. With Landry Shamet heading to Phoenix, Thomas will step in as the Nets' top bench scoring option. Terrific match between player and situation."
28,2021,Philadelphia,Jaden Springer,B,"Springer's scouting report is right there in the name – he's very springy. He is a top-shelf athlete who plays with an odd rhythm. Defenders often aren't expecting Springer's moves when he makes them. He prefers to penetrate and attempt high degree-of-difficulty leaners, but on the rare occasion he did attempt a 3, it went in at a high rate (43.5% on 1.8 attempts per game). He is not a pure point guard, and he is small for a wing, but Springer brings a fascinating change-of-pace look to any backcourt. He is definitely a Philadelphia type of player – unorthodox, high energy, and a reluctant perimeter shooter. At only 18, Springer's game has lots of room to grow."
29,2021,Brooklyn,Day'Ron Sharpe,B,"Sharpe is a load on the block who gobbles up offensive rebounds at a rate unlike anyone else in this draft. He snagged more than 3 per game in less than 20 minutes of action for the Tar Heels. Sharpe flashes tremendous touch on the block and has an array of duck-ins and drop-steps. At this point in his development, he has no outside shot to speak of and he is a terrible foul shooter. He will also seriously struggle to keep his feet in front of quicker guards if he gets caught on a switch in the pick and roll. Sharpe has more than enough raw talent, tenacity, and upside to justify his selection with the Nets, but he will require some work if he is to carve out a niche in today's pace-and-space game. He brings a dimension to this Brooklyn squad that is currently missing, so look for Sharpe to have plenty of chances to earn minutes alongside some teammates you may have heard of."
30,2021,Memphis,Santi Aldama,D,"Aldama was one of college basketball's most productive 7-footers last season, posting 21.2 ppg, 10.1 rpg and 1.7 bpg for Loyola. The Spanish product is a sharp perimeter shooter and better-than-you'd-expect passer. He even shows an emerging face-up game. He is a smart, well-rounded player, but lacks the athleticism/explosiveness of most NBA bigs. He will struggle mightily to defend in space against the NBA's quicker guards, due to his terrible lateral footspeed. He racked up a lot of his stats against subpar competition. Utah likely views Aldama as a long-term project who needs to improve his physical strength and especially his quickness if he hopes to hang in the NBA."
31,2021,Washington,Isaiah Todd,B+,"Much like Ziaire Williams, Todd enters this draft with intriguing potential, considerable offensive upside, and several question marks. Todd projects as a strong three-level scorer who can convert off-the-catch opportunities and create his own offense off the bounce. At just under 6-9, Todd has the measurables of a switch-everything, versatile perimeter defender. However, at this point in his development, he hasn't quite put it all together. He prefers low-efficiency midrange looks to 3s and layups, and his effort on defense can charitably be described as ""lacking."" He steps into a terrific situation in Milwaukee. He will be allowed to develop at his own pace and could end up becoming a legit asset for this franchise."
32,2021,New York,Jeremiah Robinson-Earl,B+,The Villanova product is a jack-of-all-trades wing who can blow up any pick-and-roll combination. He projects as a high-level role player who will do everything asked of him. Robinson-Earl is a streaky-at-best shooter and he doesn't have any single attribute in his game that would wow anybody. But it's impossible to envision a scenario where Robinson-Earl isn't at least a solid glue guy.
33,2021,LA Clippers,Jason Preston,A-,"Preston is one of this draft's most cerebral players. He was a consistent triple-double threat the last two seasons for Ohio, posting phenomenal counting stats across the board with solid shooting percentages from the field. He is a serious work in progress defensively, however. Even though Preston is a better athlete than one would think, nobody would use the word ""explosive"" to describe his game. One major red flag: 59.6% from the line and only 70% for his career – a terrible number for a guard who seems like a much better shooter than that. But at this point in the draft, he is definitely a worthwhile gamble."
34,2021,New York,Rokas Jokubaitis,B+,"Jokubaitis is a tricky player. He bobs, weaves, ducks, and jitters his way through defenses and shows terrific finishing ability with either hand. He's tall for a point guard and can see angles smaller players can't. He's a good perimeter shooter and should develop into an above-average pick-and-roll player. He plays with a nasty streak, too – even on defense. He isn't a stellar athlete and will struggle early on with the speed/strength of NBA competition, but the Goran Dragic comparisons might not be totally off-base in a few years."
35,2021,New Orleans,Herbert Jones,A-,"Jones is an athletic, switchable wing with terrific defensive upside and surprising secondary playmaking skills. He slides his feet well along the perimeter and can effectively switch onto slippery guards and physically imposing wings. He is a solid rebounder and can even provide a little bit of rim protection in smaller lineups. He isn't going to create his own offense, and at nearly 23 years of age, he'll come into the league as a nearly finished product. But his defensive potential and basketball IQ will serve him well at the next level."
36,2021,New York,Miles McBride,A,"McBride really loves to get after it. The West Virginia product is an unselfish combo guard and a tenacious on-ball defender. He made significant improvements across the board between his freshman and sophomore seasons, and even worked himself into a high-level 3-point shooter (41.4% on nearly 4 attempts per game). He isn't a ""clear out and let him cook"" type of player ¬¬– more of a change-of-pace guard a team can trust. He plays his best in big moments and takes excellent care of the ball. McBride is a tremendous value pick at this point in the draft."
37,2021,Charlotte,JT Thor,B+,"Thor is among this draft's best help-and-recover defenders. At nearly 6-10 with an enormous 7-3 wingspan, Thor can disrupt plays at the point of attack, rotate to protect the rim, and even block/alter 3-pointers like Mitchell Robinson. His defensive upside is truly special. Offensively, his run-and-dunk highlights are terrific – it's just the rest of his game that needs work. He is a poor ball handler who gives the ball away much too easily, and his 3-point stroke is still a ways away from becoming a threat. The fundamentals are solid, though, so if he can drop corner 3s with any kind of consistency, Thor's defensive versatility will shine."
38,2021,Chicago,Ayo Dosunmu,A-,"Dosunmu was the focal point of nearly every offensive position during his junior season at Illinois. The lanky 6-5 combo guard stuffed the stat sheet in every category and maintained decent efficiency given his heavy workload. He doesn't have any singular skill one would call elite – instead, he's very good at everything. His top-end speed is limited, however, and it's unlikely that he will ever command an NBA offense the way he did in college. I like Dosunmu's potential as a fifth starter once he adjusts to the speed of the NBA – he is exactly the kind of low-maintenance, high-IQ, winning-plays type of glue guy who ends up quietly carving out a 12-year career."
39,2021,Sacramento,Neemias Queta,A,"Queta is an old-school center with incredible physical strength and athleticism for his size. Nobody has Queta's combination of measurables – maybe ever. He tops out every category – height, length, vertical leap, lane agility – you name it, and Queta crushes it. He isn't just a workout warrior, either. Queta posted strong counting stats across the board with Utah State. He's a strong interior scorer and rim protector. However, the modern game has simply shifted away from everything Queta does well. He will have a hard time trying to corral the high pick-and-roll, and he offers no perimeter shooting whatsoever. He still represents tremendous value at this point in the draft and will be a matchup nightmare on second units."
40,2021,Utah,Jared Butler,B+,"Much like his teammate Davion Mitchell, Butler improved in every facet of his game during his college career en route to a national title. At 6-3 and just under 200 pounds, Butler possesses NBA size and length for the point guard spot. He rarely takes bad shots and he is equally comfortable creating his own looks and setting up his teammates. He is a heady, active defender who averaged 2 steals a game, while playing perfect, fundamentally sound defense – rarely reaching, rarely gambling. He is a tier below the game's best point guards athletically, and he commits way more turnovers than one would expect (nearly 3 per game). But it's easy to envision a scenario where Butler is a strong, steady third guard for a playoff team thanks to his spot-up shooting ability and his playmaking skills."
41,2021,San Antonio,Joe Wieskamp,A-,"The lanky wing is one of the draft's best pure shooters. Wieskamp fills it up from all over the floor with a quick release and rock-solid fundamentals. He is a tremendous catch-and-shoot performer, and can even attack over-aggressive closeouts with a slick dribble-drive game. He defended well at the NBA combine and impressed scouts with his willingness to compete. He still gives up a bit in terms of raw strength and speed, but Wieskamp's overall skill level and long-range shooting will allow him to stick in the league."
42,2021,Detroit,Isaiah Livers,B,"Livers is a very good perimeter shooter with a surprisingly thick frame. He rebounds better than most shooting specialists and he has the kind of raw physical strength that keeps him from getting picked on defensively. He suffered a fracture in his foot during his senior season with Michigan, which hurt his draft stock, but he seems to have fully recovered. He doesn't handle the ball at a high level and won't create his own offense, but Livers' spot-up shooting skills and high-IQ mentality should serve him well."
43,2021,Portland,Greg Brown,B-,"Brown is yet another eye-popping athlete from Texas. His overall skill level needs to improve, but his highlights will make anyone's jaws drop. He uses his athleticism effectively on both sides of the ball, flying for highlight-reel dunks and soul-shattering rejections. If Brown's basketball IQ or fundamentals ever catch up with his run-and-jump ability, he could be a high-end starter. But the gap between those areas is a bit too wide right now."
44,2021,Brooklyn,Kessler Edwards,B,"Edwards is an intriguing two-way wing with unexpectedly solid perimeter shooting ability and defensive versatility. At only 20, he has plenty of untapped upside remaining. We have yet to see him display any kind of off-the-dribble shot creation – for himself or for anyone else. But as a plug-and-play glue guy, Edwards fits the bill. Will his odd shooting form translate at the next level?"
45,2021,Boston,Juhann Begarin,B+,"Begarin is a blur in the open court who loves to mash dunks in a crowd. The lanky French wing has a terrific wingspan (nearly 7 feet) and the kind of mentality and instincts that translate well into a versatile, switchable defender. His brain has yet to catch up with his feet, however, as he reads the game a beat slow and his overall skillset will need some fine tuning. Begarin's athleticism and upside (he's only 19) are at least as good as anyone else's at this point in the draft, though."
46,2021,Toronto,Dalano Banton,C-,"Banton is an interesting point-forward who excels at making plays for others. At 6-7, Banton can make passes over the top of defense with either hand. However, he is a non-shooter at this point, and at age 21, it's unclear whether he can get his shooting stroke in order. He struggled to defend in college, as well."
47,2021,Toronto,David Johnson,B,"Johnson is a tough-as-nails combo guard whose NBA calling card will be his defensive tenacity and versatility. Offensively, he is an unselfish playmaker who has worked hard to improve his jump shot. It's hard to envision a scenario where he becomes an above-average NBA scoring threat, but if he can develop into a knock-down spot-up shooter, there is intriguing 3-and-D potential here."
48,2021,Atlanta,Sharife Cooper,A-,"Cooper plays with a unique flair for the dramatic. This pass-first point guard can drop dimes from any angle with either hand. Cooper is an excellent ball handler who can finish with either hand with an assortment of layups and floaters to keep the defense honest. It's hard to average 20 points and 8 assists per game at the college level, but Cooper is the rare kind of guard whose passes create openings that weren't there originally. On the downside, Cooper is extremely thin and he is a terrible 3-point shooter (under 23% on nearly 5 attempts per game). His value drops dramatically if defenders can simply sag under screens and dare him to shoot. But at this point in the draft, he is more than worth the gamble."
49,2021,Brooklyn,Marcus Zegarowski,B-,"Zegarowski is a tough, heady point guard who can knock down shots from well beyond the arc and effectively run an NBA offense. He's a strong pick-and-roll player with a nose for the ball on defense. He's extremely limited athletically and will give up serious size/length against the league's top guards, but there is a whiff of TJ McConnell potential here."
50,2021,Philadelphia,Filip Petrusev,B+,"The tall, long Serbian was the Adriatic League MVP and filled up the stat sheet with Mega Soccerbet. Prior to his overseas pro career, stateside hoops fans might remember Petrusev from his time with the Gonzaga Bulldogs. He started out as a post-only scorer, but has now developed into a knock-down 3-point shooter. He'll struggle defensively, as he is neither physical or quick, but his all-around offensive skillset is quite intriguing."
51,2021,LA Clippers,BJ Boston,A-,"Few prospects have Boston's upside at this point in the draft. He came into Kentucky as a consensus top-10 recruit and a likely lottery pick, but his stock took a serious tumble after a disappointing freshman season in Lexington. But few 6-7 wings have Boston's shot-creation ability – both for himself and others. At his best, Boston is a devastating one-on-one player with an array of stepbacks, leaners, and long-range bombs. He needs to add two helpings of strength and maturity before he can begin to approach his ceiling as a pro. At this point, Boston takes way too many bad shots and it's hard to envision an NBA coach who will tolerate that."
52,2021,Detroit,Luka Garza,B,"The consensus college basketball player of the year can do a bit of everything from the center spot. Need him to mash dudes on the block? Need him to knock down 3s (44%!)? Need him to crash the boards? Need him to make plays for others? Garza checks all the boxes. Why did he slide so far in the draft? Simple – he can't defend at an NBA level right now. He will get picked on in high pick-and-rolls incessantly until a coach has no choice but to sub him out. If Garza can develop into a passable defender, he will stick in the league. If not, well, he will always have all his collegiate accolades."
53,2021,Philadelphia,Charles Bassey,A-,"It seems as if we have been tracking Bassey's draft status for the last decade. Few big men are as productive as Bassey – 17.6 ppg, 11.6 rpg, 3.1 bpg – and he still has upside remaining. He is so long and athletic, and he uses every inch of that 7-3 wingspan to grab every rebound in his vicinity. He still finds himself out of position defensively, as he tries to block every shot in sight, but he works his butt off and always seeks to improve his game. He has even started to flash a little bit of a jump shot, which was not something we saw from him as a freshman."
54,2021,Milwaukee,Sandro Mamukelashvili,C+,"It's not every day you see someone with Mamukelashvili's frame who runs the offense like a guard. The burly power forward loves to pass out of the high post and even run point in transition. His shot mechanics are all over the place, but he shoots it without hesitation. He is a terrible defensive player – simultaneously not quick enough to guard on the perimeter or long enough to protect the rim or play drop coverage."
55,2021,Oklahoma City,Aaron Wiggins,B,"For someone who projects as a 3-and-D prospect, Wiggins flashes a nice all-around floor game with a decent outside stroke and occasional playmaking skills. He plays with great effort and intensity, as well. He doesn't have any single skill that pops out and gives up a bit of size/length compared to other 3-and-Ders, but Wiggins has a high floor compared to other second rounders."
56,2021,Charlotte,Scottie Lewis,B,"Lewis is one of the draft's best pure athletes and uses that athleticism most effectively on defense. Teams could take Lewis' film from Florida and use it to teach defensive fundamentals. Offensively, he's still a major work in progress. He is an inconsistent shooter, and the fewer dribbles he takes, the better. His defensive upside is well worth it at this late stage of round two."
57,2021,Detroit,Balsa Koprivica,C,"Koprivica is a high-energy center that has worked hard to develop his all-around skill level. The Serbian was a highly regarded recruit prior to joining Florida State, but he still needs to make serious improvements as a rebounder and positional defender – he often finds himself in foul trouble – if he hopes to make a dent in the NBA."
58,2021,New York,Jericho Sims,A-,"The final high-level athlete out of Texas is off the board. Sims is a – stop me if you've heard this before – jaw-dropping athlete who can hammer home dunks with the best of them. He gets after it on the glass and loves to block every shot within a 10-foot radius. He is a non-shooter who struggles big time at the foul line, and he often finds himself a step behind the game in half-court settings, but if Sims can put it all together, he could be a steal at 58."
59,2021,Brooklyn,Raiquan Gray,B,"I don't think I've ever seen a player quite like Gray. Anthony Mason maybe? No, that's not quite right – Mason was taller. Gray is an impossible-to-define playmaking boulder with much more shimmy and shake than one would expect with his frame. Florida State utilized him as an offensive hub who could do a little bit of everything with the ball in his hands. He struggles mightily with two important things – his shot and his weight. His 3pt% (26.7) is almost identical to his listed weight (269). One needs to go way up, and the other needs to go way down."
60,2021,Milwaukee,Georgios Kalaitzakis,C-,"This lanky/scrawny Greek wing has been a big-time winner at every level in his professional career. He is an active slasher who loves to put pressure on opposing defenses, but he's wild (occasionally careless) with the ball and will need to improve his body before he can handle the rigors of the NBA. He is a likely draft-and-stash prospect."
